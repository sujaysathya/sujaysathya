### Hi there üëã


I'm Sujay, a 20 year old student currently studying at [SSN College of Engineering](https://www.ssn.edu.in/), Chennai. I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and  Engineering. I'm also an Undergraduate Research Assistant at [Solarillion Foundation](https://solarillionfoundation.org/), where I'm currently working on project related to Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing. I really like coding and I'm experienced (slightly) in programming languages like Python, C++ and Java, to name a few.  

I'm really interested in trying to automate loads of tasks I do daily using the simplest scripts I can, and I'm proud to say that I've succeeded in doing so (only for a few tasks though xD).

## Projects

I built an advanced (sort of) Python script that attends your online classes and answers very basic questions for you in your place! Check it out [here.](https://github.com/sujaysathya/bunk_bot) (By the way, I am in no way responsible if someone does, in fact, use this to attend online classes. That's on them.)

 ‚úàÔ∏è As part of my research in [Solarillion Foundation](https://github.com/solarillion), I built a two stage Machine Learning model to classify flights as delayed or not delayed, and to predict the time of delay (in minutes), if there was delay present. Check it out [here.](https://github.com/sujaysathya/flight_delay_prediction)



## Contact Me!

I'm highly interested in contributing to any open-source project I can. If you want to work together, or show me a place/repository to contribute to, contact me!
